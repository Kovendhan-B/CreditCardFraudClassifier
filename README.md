**# CreditCardFraudClassifierProject Title**
**Credit Card Genuine or Fraud Transaction Classifier**

**Project Description**
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify credit card transactions as genuine or fraudulent. Using historical transaction data, the model identifies patterns and anomalies to detect fraudulent activities. This solution helps financial institutions minimize fraudulent transactions and improve transaction security.

**Features**
Classification of transactions as genuine or fraudulent.
Supports multiple machine learning algorithms for comparison.
Data preprocessing, including handling of imbalanced datasets and scaling.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
Cross-validation for robust performance evaluation.

**Dataset**
